## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **machine learning model** to accurately predict the price of diamonds based on key attributes such as **carat, cut, color, clarity, and more**. 

By leveraging **data science techniques**, our goal is to create a **robust and reliable model** that provides pricing insights for:
- **Buyers** looking for fair market prices.
- **Sellers** seeking competitive pricing.
- **Enthusiasts** interested in diamond valuation.

## 📊 Dataset
We are using a **publicly available dataset** that includes various features influencing diamond prices:

| Feature  | Description |
|----------|------------|
| **Carat** | Weight of the diamond. |
| **Cut** | Quality of the diamond's cut (**Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal**). |
| **Color** | Diamond color grade (**J (worst) to D (best)**). |
| **Clarity** | Measurement of internal flaws (**I1 (worst) to IF (best)**). |
| **Depth** | Total depth percentage. |
| **Table** | Width of the top of the diamond relative to its widest point. |
| **X, Y, Z** | Dimensions of the diamond in mm. |
| **Price** | The price of the diamond in USD (**target variable**). |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** (Regression models)
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**

## 🚀 Goals & Expected Outcomes
- Develop an **accurate predictive model** for diamond prices.
- Understand the **impact of different attributes** on pricing.
- Provide **data-driven insights** for valuation.
